It's awesome. The only issue is that these message stay unread, and seeing a bunch of unread messages in my archive or labels annoys me, so every morning I search \"label:unread\" and mark all as read. It's a total first world problem, but annoying nonetheless. I've been looking for some sort of app or something to auto-mark-as-read any messages not in the inbox for months now. Then someone recently pointed me to Google Apps Script and 10 minutes later I had a script running which automatically marks all archived messages as read every minute. I was blown away at how easy this was. Here's how it's done. Head to script.google.com to start a script. Choose to create a script for Gmail in the little popup. Delete all the sample code it gives you. Replace it with this (written using the API reference): function markArchivedAsRead () { var threads = GmailApp . search ( \"label:unread -label:inbox\" ); GmailApp . markThreadsRead ( threads ); } Save the project with File > Save. Add a new version using File > Manage Versions and enter \"initial version\" then submit that. Do a test run using Run > markArchivedAsRead and be sure and authorize the app when it asks you to. Add a new trigger using Resource > Current Project's Triggers and choose to run the above function every minute (or hour or day or whatever if you want to be nice to Google's servers). Save the script again and exit. Don't worry, it will keep running. And you're done. It will continue to run every minute until you stop it. How awesome is that? Update: Some people are reporting an error which says \"This operation can only be applied to at most 100 threads. (line 3, file \"Code\")\". To fix this, you have to manually do a search for \"is:unread\" and mark all of them as read before running the script, so that it starts with a clean slate. The script can only process 100 threads per run, so if you give it more than 100 on the first run, that'll obviously bust it.","title":"Gmail Mark As Read Script"},{"location":"general/gmailMarkAsRead/#marking_gmail_read_with_apps_script","text":"Recent versions of Android give you the ability to Archive an email right from the notification bar: I use this like 30 times a day, for emails that I can tell from the subject that I don't need to read.

Installation \u00b6 Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - meta Usage \u00b6 Metadata is written as a series of key-value pairs at the beginning of the Markdown document, delimited by a blank line which ends the metadata context. Naturally, the metadata is stripped from the document before rendering the actual page content and made available to the theme. Example: title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. path: path/to/file source: file.js # Headline ... See the next section which covers the metadata that is supported by Material. Overriding the title \u00b6 The page title can be overridden on a per-document level: title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet This will set the title tag inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. It will also override the default behavior of Material for MkDocs which appends the site title using a dash as a separator to the page title. Overriding the description \u00b6 The page description can also be overridden on a per-document level: description : Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. This will set the meta tag containing the site description inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Linking sources \u00b6 When a document is related to a specific set of source files and the repo_url is defined inside the project's mkdocs.yml , the files can be linked using the source key: source: file.js A new entry at the bottom of the table of contents is generated that is linking to the section listing the linked source files. Multiple files can be linked by adding filenames on separate lines: source: file.js file.css The filenames are appended to the repo_url set in your mkdocs.yml , but can be prefixed with a path to ensure correct path resolving: Example: path: tree/master/docs/extensions source: metadata.md Result: See the source section for the resulting output.","title":"Metadata per Page"},{"location":"markdownCheatSheet/metaData/#metadata","text":"The Metadata extension makes it possible to add metadata to a document which gives more control over the theme in a page-specific context.","title":"Metadata"},{"location":"markdownCheatSheet/metaData/#installation","text":"Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - meta","title":"Installation"},{"location":"markdownCheatSheet/metaData/#usage","text":"Metadata is written as a series of key-value pairs at the beginning of the Markdown document, delimited by a blank line which ends the metadata context.

Option 2 \u00b6 If you don't want to back up your entire system, but only specific files, I suggest you connect to your Raspberry Pi via SFTP and copy the files to your local computer (You can use the WinScp client). If you have SSH enabled, SFTP usually requires no special configuration on the Raspberry Pi side. Another option is to copy the files to a remote system using rsync . You can also install special drivers so your Windows can read ext filesystems (and will thus be able to read the whole SD card), such as ext2fsd but it is probably not worth the effort. Since the image will be of the same size as your SD card, you may want to compress it.
