# Android Penetration Testing

## Frida Server for SSL Pinning Bypass

Requirements:

-   Rooted Adnroid Phone
-   Python 3
-   pip(pip3)

Install Frida framework, objection to your host

```bash
pip3 install frida-tools
pip3 install objection
```

Download [Frida Server](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases)
Extract and Rename the file to _frida-server_
Move the file to the Android Phone to **/data/local/tmp/**

Connect to adb shell to the android device

```bash
adb shell
```

Change to Root

```bash
su
```

Check if you are root

```bash
whoami
```

Change permissions to the /data/local/tmp/frida-server to be able to run the server

```bash
chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
```

Run the Frida Server in background:

```bash
/data/local/tmp/frida-server &
```

Go Back to Host Terminal
List all the Applications and find the name of the desired application you want to by bypass SSL Pinning

```bash
frida-ps -Ua
```

Now Run with the name of the application

```bash
objection -g c**********n explore -q
```

Now remove the SSL Pining with

```bash
android sslpinning disable
```

## mobFS Docker

change -v path according to your system

```bash
docker run \
-d \
-it \
-v /root/tools/mobSF:/root/.MobSF \
-h mobsf \
--name mobsf \
--restart always \
-e TZ=Asia/Jerusalem \
-p 50000:8000 \

## How to Singe APK After Compile

Install **apksigner**

```bash
apt install -y apksigner
```

Create certificate at the same folder you've compiled your modified APK

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Enter A password (we will need it to singe the APK), enter any data you wish for the certificate information. At the end enter **'y'** at the end to create the certificate.

Now we should have 2 files: your.apk, keystore.jks. The only step left is to singe the APK with new certificate.

```bash
apksigner sign --ks keystore.jks your.apk
```

When installing the APK you will be prompted with a warning of "unknown certificate" just hit Install.
